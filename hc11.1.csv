"     1Housing characteristics data were collected between August 2015 and April 2016.
     2Total U.S. includes all primary occupied housing units in the 50 states and the District of Columbia. Vacant housing units, seasonal units, second homes, military houses, and group quarters are excluded.
     3Household energy insecurity as defined in this table includes only those issues collected as part of the RECS questionnaire. Other factors, such as energy costs as a percentage of household income, could be considered as household energy insecurity, but are not included here. Respondents may report more than one energy insecurity issue.
     4Includes inability to use main heating equipment because equipment was broken and household could not have it repaired; or electricity, natural gas, or bulk fuel disruption due to lack of payment.
     5Includes inability to use air-conditoning equipment because equipment was broken and household could not have it repaired or electricity disruption due to lack of payment.
     6Housing units are classified using criteria created by the U.S. Census Bureau based on 2010 Census data. Urbanized areas are densely settled groupings of blocks or tracts with 50,000 or more people, while urban clusters have at least 2,500 but less than 50,000 people. All other areas are rural.
     7These climate regions were created by the Building America program, sponsored by the U.S. Department of Energy’s Office of Energy Efficiency and Renewable Energy (EERE).
     8A householder is a person in whose name the home is owned or rented. These characteristics refer to the householder that completed the RECS questionnaire.  
     9Householders were permitted to select more than one racial category to describe themselves. These householders are only included as More than one race.        
     10Rented includes households that occupy their primary housing units without paying rent.
     Q = Data withheld because either the Relative Standard Error (RSE) was greater than 50% or fewer than 10 cases responded.
     N = No cases responded.
     Notes:  Because of rounding, data may not sum to totals.  See RECS Terminology for definition of terms used in these tables.
